Open R1, R2, R3, R4 files at once
extract sequence lines from R2 and R3
call reverse compliment function on R3
(if)check if any of the sequences contain N
    write the corresponding read pair records (4 lines of fastq) into the unknown file

(elif)compare if the indexes are the same
    write the corresponding read pair records (4 lines of fastq) into the matching file

(else) indexes are not the same 
    write into index-hopping file

To report the number properly read pairs matched indexes, index-hopping observed, and
read-pairs with unknown index(es), count the number of sequencing lines in each corresponding file
I am not sure if we are supposed to devide the result by 2 because we are reporting it 
for 'read-pair'

I will have a function that reverse compliments a given sequence
save the complimentary base combinations in a dictionary
Read the reverse compliment index from the end, convert bases
using the dictionary to look up complimentary bases,
join into a resulting string

Another function will handle writing into a file
